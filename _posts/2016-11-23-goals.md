title: My Goals at Bloc
---

## Job Stuff

My main reason for enrolling at Bloc was to learn how to apply for jobs. The IT
job market is very mysterious and requires formal training to understand the
expectations involved. So far, I have learned to go to programming meetups and
to give people my resume.

## Engineering

The other thing I want to learn from Bloc is software engineering, so I can make
my code as efficient as possible. I would like to learn how to evaluate
algorithm efficiency with big-O notation. I would also like to learn about how
various data structures are implemented, such as hash tables.
